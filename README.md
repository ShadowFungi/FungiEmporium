## About FungiEmporium

FungiEmporium is a Twitch "bot" that is inspired by [StreamAvatars](https://streamavatars.com/) and [Simpathey's StreamBallUltimate](https://github.com/Simpathey/StreamBallUltimate) .
The main goal is to continue learning the Godot Engine, and make a Twitch "bot" that is fun to use and advanced enough to be a StreamAvatars alternative.
The second goal is to have fun making it, while creating something I can use for my rare twitch streams.
